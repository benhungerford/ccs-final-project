# Table
Table is an app that gives a party host the ability to quickly create a list of items needed for their guests to bring over for an event. Once the list is created, the host sends out a link to their guests to sign up to bring something to the table.
# Why
This past summer, we experienced the problem of not having enough food when inviting friends over for lunch. Later, my wife voiced that if everyone had been able to bring some food then we would have had enough. I wanted to create an app for someone like my wife to organize a simple way for our guests to bring something.
# Features
- Host can create event with categories of items needed.
- Host can copy link of event and send to guests.
- Host can edit the event.
- Guests visit the link and enter their names and items under the corresponding categories.
- The event is updated for both the guests and the host to see what everyone is bringing.
# API Utilized
Table uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs) to update the host (currently only me, Ben) when a guest signs up.
